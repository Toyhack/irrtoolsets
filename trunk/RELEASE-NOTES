Release Notes for IRRToolSet version 4.8.1
***************************************************

This release contains prototypes of RPSLng-aware tools from IRRToolSet: peval, rpslcheck and now RtConfig is added.

* RPSLng dictionary implemented according to the latest RPSLng draft:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blunk-rpslng-01.txt

* Tools have been tested to work with RIPE whois software. They will work also with irrd in most of the cases, as soon as irrd is updated to handle RPSLng-related objects. Separated patch for this may be necessary and will be available later.

* peval now accepts both RPSL and RPSLng filters (extended to support ipv6)
   for peval, the syntax for evaluation of mp-filter is:
  afi <afi_list> <mp-filter>
  results will be restricted to address familiy(ies) from <afi_list>.

* RtConfig has got a new command: '@RtConfig v6networks', which works symmetrically with '@RtConfig networks'. Other RtConfig commands have been modified to handle RPSLng.
