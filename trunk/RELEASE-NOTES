Release Notes for IRRToolSet
****************************

Version 4.8.3:

A set of patches collected by Hagen Boehm was applied.

Also, a few changes were made to allow the code to compile with the
lastest version of g++.

As of 4.8.3, binaries will no longer be made put on the FTP site for 
new versions.

Version 4.8.1:

This release contains prototypes of RPSLng-aware tools from
IRRToolSet: peval, rpslcheck and now RtConfig is added.

* RPSLng dictionary implemented according to the latest RPSLng draft:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blunk-rpslng-01.txt

* Tools have been tested to work with RIPE whois software. They will
  work also with irrd in most of the cases, as soon as irrd is updated
  to handle RPSLng-related objects. Separated patch for this may be
  necessary and will be available later.

* peval now accepts both RPSL and RPSLng filters (extended to support
  ipv6) for peval, the syntax for evaluation of mp-filter is:
  afi <afi_list> <mp-filter>
  results will be restricted to address familiy(ies) from <afi_list>.

* RtConfig has got a new command: '@RtConfig v6networks', which works
  symmetrically with '@RtConfig networks'. Other RtConfig commands
  have been modified to handle RPSLng.
