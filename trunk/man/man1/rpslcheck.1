.SH NAME
prcheck
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B prcheck
.RI [ flags ]\ [<as-no>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
prcheck syntax-checks the aut-num object for <as-no> registered 
in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR).
It only checks the syntax of policy related attributes 
such as as-in, and default.
If an aut-num passes prcheck's syntax checking,
it will not create cause errors to any of the tools in RAToolSet, 
such as RtConfig.
Future versions of this tool will generate better error messages and do
more than just syntax checking.
.SH RAToolSet COMMON OPTIONS
.RS
.IP -help
Print summary of command-line options and abort.
.IP "\-T [whois_query | whois_response | input | all]"

.IP "\-p <port-no>"
Establish an radbserver connection to port <port-no>.
.IP "\-protocol <protocol>"

If an object is defined in multiple sources in <source-list>,
prcheck uses the definition first encountered in <source-list>
