summary: ifaddr in inet-rtr object works wrong for RtConfig

detail:

command: @RtConfig configureRouter <inet-rtr-name>

inet-rtr:
ifaddr: x.x.x.x/x
peer: 

It converted x.x.x.x/x to x.x.x.x/32 and considere it and _only_ it as local interface address.
Tried to fix it by adding expansion to multiple /32's and selecting the policy from aut-num for each of these /32's.  However, not sure if this is right way of how ifaddr attribute works... Need to be considered.

Fixed. Now ifaddr is first /32. Iterator goes through all "ifaddr" attrs and all peers. 
Do we need to put 'interface' and extra neighbour statement there to understand how the peering is fully described???
