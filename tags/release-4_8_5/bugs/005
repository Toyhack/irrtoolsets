detail:

This is new feature for aoe. since 4.7.2.

The feature for saving the PeerList with statuses ( may be
convenient as small consistency check). Was not present before, now
implemented. Stil do not know if it is needed. Basically, in ListSave "<<"
operator is overloaded, and it converts TclList, which is list of peers, to
the string, and prints it to the file.
