.SH NAME
aoe (Autonomous System Object Editor)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aoe
.RI [ flags ]\ [<as-no>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
aoe is a C++/Tcl/Tk program that displays the aut-num object for <as-no>.
aoe organizes the display into four parts:
a "Peer List" on the left hand side
for listing peer ASes and one of them will be selected to restrict policy 
editing only to that peer;
a "Policy Generation Area" on the middle right hand side
for editing the as-in, as-out and default attributes
for the selected peer;
a "Peer's Policy Area" on the bottom right hand side
for displaying the selected peer's policy for your AS; 
and  
an "aut-num Area" on the top right hand side
for displaying the aut-num object for  <as-no>
and for hand editing attributes
including the administrative attributes.
aoe simplifies the creation of aut-num objects 
by employing some heuristics to  
add and modify as-in and as-out attributes.
For example, 
given a BGP dump from a router inside <as-no>, 
aoe parses the AS_PATH attributes in the BGP dump,
and determines the peer ASes 
by taking the first AS number in the AS_PATH attributes, 
and the import policies for each peer AS
by taking the last AS number in the AS_PATHs that start with the peer's
AS number.
A template based mechanism is provided
for users
to create their own heuristics
to augment the heuristics that we provide.  
aoe can register the aut-num object in the IRR
after editing is done.

If <as-no> is not specified it is deduced for your system from the 
IP address of your host and IRR.

.RS
.IP IRR_HOST
Specifies the RAWhoisd host to connect.
.IP IRR_PORT
Specifies the RAWhoisd port number to connect.
.IP IRR_SOURCES
Specifies the source list (comma separated) to consider.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.PP
Invoke aoe using your AS number,
.nf
	% aoe AS226
.fi
aoe will acquire the aut-num object from the IRR
and display the list of peers in the "Peer List".  
Each AS number in this list is followed by the following indications:
IRR, BGP, and NEW.
The indication IRR means that the peer is derived from the policy in the
aut-num object by inspecting 
the as-in and as-out attributes.
The indication BGP means that the peer is derived from
an AS_PATH attribute in a BGP dump.
The indication NEW means that the peer is created manually by the user.
.SH BUTTONS
.RS
.IP "Delete Peer"
This button is located at the bottom of "Peer List".  It is used to 
delete the selected peer from the "Peer List"
and the associated policies from the "aut-num Area".
.IP "Add Peer"
This button is located at the right hand side of the "Delete Peer" button.
It allows users to add
new peers manually.  
There will be a NEW indication next to the created peer.
.IP "Edit	"
This is a toggle button and located below the "aut-num Area".
It is used to enable/disable the editing of "aut-num Area".  When
this button is clicked, the label for this button will become 
"Edit Done!" which means that
if it is clicked again, the manual editing will cease.
Be sure to click "Edit Done!" button before clicking any others else,
otherwise, users will lost the changes. After clicking "Edit Done!" button the syntax of the object in the aut-num area will be checked. Warning message will pop up if any syntax errors detected.
.IP "Update IRR"
This button is located at the bottom right corner of the 
"aut-num Area".  It is used to register the modified aut-num 
object in the "aut-num Area" in the IRR.
.IP Import
This is a toggle button and located on the right hand side of 
"Policy Generation Area".  It allows users to display/hide the as-in
attributes of the current working aut-num object.  It is useful when
a user prefers working only on the export policies.
.IP Export
This is a toggle button and located on the right hand side of 
"Policy Generation Area".  It allows users to display/hide the as-out
attributes of the current working aut-num object.  It is useful when
a user prefers working only on the import policies.
.IP Templates
This is a pull-down menu with the following options:
.RS
.IP "from IRR" 
aoe displays the policy in the "Policy Generation Area" as
registered in your aut-num object;
.IP "from BGP Dump" 
aoe generates the policy from the BGP dump;
.IP "from Peer's aut-num" 
aoe generates import policy from the export policy 
of the peer AS
and export policy from the import policy of the peer AS; 
.IP "Provider" 
aoe assumes that your peer AS is a provider AS.
It generates policies so that
your AS accepts any route from the peer AS,
and announces only its own routes; 
.IP "Customer" 
aoe assumes that your peer AS is a customer AS.
It generates policies so that
your AS accepts only the customer's own routes
and announces all the routes;
.IP "Transit"
aoe assumes that your AS and the peer AS provide transit service to each
other.
It generates policies so that
all routes are imported from and exported to the peer AS. 
.IP "Non-transit"
aoe generates policies so that
your AS accepts only the peer AS's routes,
and announces only your own routes; 
.IP "Non-transit (AS_PATH)" 
This is identical to the previous template
but it generates policies using AS_PATH notation.
Any one of the above templates can also be changed to use AS_PATH based 
policies by editing its template.
.RE
.IP Append
This button is located on the right hand side of "Policy Generation Area".
It appends the policy in the "Policy Generation Area" 
to the aut-num object in the "aut-num Area".
.IP Replace
This button is located on the right hand side of "Policy Generation Area".
It replaces
the policies for the selected AS in the "aut-num Area"
with the policies in the "Policy Generation Area".
.IP "aoe logo"
This button is located at the right bottom corner of aoe display.
It displays the down-loading information of aoe and RAToolSet tools.
.SH MENUS
.PP
.RS
.IP "File/Save or F2"
A filename will be prompted.  
The content in the "aut-num Area" will be saved to this file.
.IP "File/Save Peer List"
A filename will be prompted.
The content in the "Peer List Area" will be saved to this file.
.IP "File/Open or F3"
A filename will be prompted.  
The content of this file will be loaded and displayed
in the "aut-num Area".  
This is useful as a template for the non-policy attributes,
or for storing and retrieving intermediate results between aoe sessions.
.IP "File/Load BGP dump"
A filename will be prompted.  
This file should contain the BGP dump from a router in your AS.
For each AS_PATH in this file,
aoe uses the first AS number to determine a peer AS
and the last AS number to determine an AS whose routes are imported
from this peer.
.IP "File/Print"
A command for printing will be prompted.
The content in the "aut-num Area" 
will be piped to this command.
.IP "File/Quit or Alt-X"
This will end your aoe session.	
.IP "Configure/IRR update commands"
A dialog box displaying the IRRs and the corresponding update
commands will pop-up.
This dialog box can be used to select an IRR site for registration.
To register your aut-num object,
aoe will pipe the aut-num object in the "aut-num Area" 
to the update command for the selected registry.
.IP "Configure/Policy templates"
There are "Add" and "Delete" buttons.  The "Add" button is used to create 
new templates for import (i.e. as-in) and export (i.e. as-out) policies.  
When the "Add" button is clicked,
a blank template will be appended to the existing templates.  
It allows the users to type in a new policy template.
Within the templates,
the macros "$MyAS" and "$PeerAS" can be used.
The macro "$MyAS" expands to your AS number
and the macro "$PeerAS" expands to the selected peer's AS number
in the "Peer List".
Be aware that these two macros are case sensitive. 
A template can be deleted by clicking on the radio button on its left
followed by clicking on the "Delete" button.  
.RE
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE USES
The following two uses may be of interest:
Say your aut-num object does not have any policies
(or you do not have any aut-num object at all).
Prepare a BGP dump from one of your routers with the most number of
external routes
(you can use "show ip bgp" on a cisco router to prepare this dump; 
other routers have similar commands).
Run aoe using your AS number.
Go to the file menu and load the BGP dump file.
The list of peer ASes will appear on the "Peer List".
Select each one of them one at a time.
If your peer is a provider AS,
click on the "Provider" template button
and click on the "Append" button.
If your peer is a customer AS,
click on the "Customer" template button 
and so on.
After specifying policies for all your peers,
click on the "Update IRR" button to register your aut-num object.
.PP
Another example is when you have an aut-num object which is not
up-to-date.
Follow the above steps.
After loading the BGP dump,
examine the indications next to each peer.
If a peer has an "IRR" indication
but no "BGP" indication,
it means that 
there is a policy registered for this peer,
but aoe could not verify if the neighbor AS still peers with you.
If the peering with this AS ceased,
please use the "Delete Peer" button to delete this peer from your aut-num
object.
If a peer has a "BGP" indication
but no "IRR" indication,
no policy for this peer AS is present.
Please use the appropriate template to register policy for this 
peer (as shown in first example).
If a peer has both the "IRR" and  the "BGP" indications,
a policy for this peer is registered
and the peering with this AS is still current.
Please verify that the policies for this peer is up-to-date.
After verifying and correcting policies for all your peers,
click on the "Update IRR" button to register your aut-num object.
.PP
.SH FILES
aoe creates a ~/.aoerc file which stores the templates, the update
commands and the printing command.  This file is not meant for hand editing.
