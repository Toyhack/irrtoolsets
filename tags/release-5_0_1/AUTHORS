IRRToolSet was originally written at the Information Sciences Institute at
the University of Southern California, as part of the Routing Arbiter
project.  The primary developer was Cengiz Alaettinoglu, with substantial
contributions from WeeSan Lee, Ramesh Govindan, Rusty Eddy and John
Mehringer.

Responsibility for the project was passed to the RIPE NCC in September 2001,
where Katie Petrusha took over primary responsibility of the project and
implemented multiprotocol support and RPSLng.

ISC, The Internet Systems Consortium, took over the project in November
2004.  Since then, it has received care from Shane Kerr and non-ISC members
of the community, including Hagen Boehm, S.P.Zeidler, Timo Koehler, HÃ¥vard
Eidnes, Faidon Liambotis and Nick Hilliard.
