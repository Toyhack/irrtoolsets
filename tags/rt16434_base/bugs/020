Some ISP's operate their own private databases and I think that they would be interested in being able to configure their own registry/source in roe.  Also, there are many registries now in the Internet Routing Registry, many more than just ANS, MCI [which no longer exists, it was acquired by another company], CANET [which is now Bell Canada ?], RIPE [which, AFAIK, is still RIPE :-) ] and the RADB.  It would be nice to be able to add new registries or to read a configuration file of registries.

Lastly, if someone is giving training on RAToolSet/RtConfig :-), then it is very useful to configure a local test database for training purposes, or to point to the RIPE [NCC] TEST Database.

If I modify roe_config.cc, then I must re-compile the toolset; I might do this next week.
