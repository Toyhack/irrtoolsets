ACG.hh
ACG.cc
	previously used only in network/Prefix.cc
	removed

There is a slightly complicated inderdependency of files in this directory.

class MLCG referenced by:
	Core/util/List.hh
	Core/sys/Time.cc

class Uniform referenced by:
	Core/util/List.hh
	Core/sys/Time.cc

class RNG referenced by:
	class MLCG
	class Uniform

class Random referenced by
	class RNG
	class Uniform

So, by removing MLCG and Uniform from Core/util/List.hh and
Core/sys/Time.cc, it will be possible to remove classes MLCG, Uniform, RNG
and Random.
