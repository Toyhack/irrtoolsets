.TH rpslcheck 1 local
.SH NAME
rpslcheck
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpslcheck
.RI [ flags ]\ [<as-no>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
rpslcheck syntax-checks any RPSL object. If the object passes rpslcheck's syntax check it will not cause errors to any of the tools in IRRToolSet, such as RtConfig. However, the syntax constraints of a particular IRR can differ from the ones in RPSL.
.PP
The input can be supplied via "-as <ASnum>" option (only AS-numbers). If no option is specified the object is expected as a standard input. The input can contain multiple objects.
.PP
Future versions of this tool will generate better error messages and do
more than just syntax checking.
.SH IRRToolSet COMMON OPTIONS
.RS
.IP -help
Print summary of command-line options and abort.
.IP "\-T [whois_query | whois_response | input | all]"
Trace the argument. Useful for debugging.
.IP "\-D <integer>"
Print debugging messages of debug channel <integer> 
(if compiled with DEBUG defined).
.IP "\-version"
Print the version number and quit.
.IP "\-h <host-name>"
Establish a whois connection to host <host-name>.
The default is whois.radb.net
.IP "\-p <port-no>"
Establish a whois connection to port <port-no>.
The default is 43.
.IP "\-protocol <protocol>"
Use the <protocol> to connect to the IRR server. <protocol> can be irrd(rawhoisd), ripe(bird), and ripe_perl. The default is irrd. The ripe_perl option should be used with the old ripe server.
.IP "\-s <source-list>"
Consider the sources specified in the comma separated <source-list>.
If an object is defined in multiple sources in <source-list>,
prcheck uses the definition first encountered in <source-list>
from left to right.
.IP \-rusage
Print resource usage upon completion.
.IP "\-ignore_errors"
Do not print error and warning messages due to communication to the
database server or parsing policy objects.
.IP "\-report_errors"
Print error and warning messages due to communication to the
database server or parsing policy objects.
.RE
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.RS
.IP "\-as <as-no>"
Syntax check the aut-num object for <as-no>. 
If this option is not supplied, stdin is parsed.
.IP "\-echo"
Print the aut-num object before matching.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.RS
.IP IRR_HOST
Specifies the IRR host to connect.
.IP IRR_PORT
Specifies the IRR port number to connect.
.IP IRR_SOURCES
Specifies the source list (comma separated) to consider.
.RE
.PP
Command line options take precedence over environment variables.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.nf
	% ./rpslcheck 
	Congratulations no errors were found in parsing AS226	
	% rpslcheck AS3130
