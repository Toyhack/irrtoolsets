detail:

Display IRR policy for AS and PeerAS.
PeerAS is selected from the Peer List (on the left).

No policies from IRR where diplayed for AS and PeerAS. The problem
was in AutNumImportIterator/AutNumExportIterator constructor;
AutNumImportExportIterator::isMatching had errors; and never returned 'true'
value; object for AutNumImportExportIterator was never created. fixed by
implementing the proper search in the function isMatching(PolicyExpr
*policy). There also was a bug with resolving the peers from peering-sets and as
-sets. I'm not 100% sure the idea of expansion is correct, but it is implemented
 now.

changed:
irr/autnum.hh           bool AutNumImportExportIterator::isMatching(PolicyExpr * policy)
aoe/aoe.cc              int AoeApplication::getASInfoFromServer(void)
