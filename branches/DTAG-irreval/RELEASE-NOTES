* don't barf on inet6num: assignment-size (RIPE policy proposal 2010-06)

* RFC 5952 requires that ipv6 addresses be presented in lower case.

* ipv6 addresses are now printed in optimised format.

* added geoloc: and language: fields to both inetnum: and inet6num: objects.

* compilation fixes for g++ 4.7 / debian wheeze

* stop talking asdot to IRRDBs.  none of the IRRs supports asdot since ~2010

Version 5.0.0

Substantial reorganisation of package.  Only rtconfig, peval and rpslcheck survived. 
For further information on changes for 5.0.0, please consult the irrtoolset
wiki on http://irrtoolset.isc.org/

Version 4.8.5:

Improved support for compilation on 64-bit environments.

Integrated a number of fixes from the NetBSD port as proposed by
Havard Eidnes. These include:

* Numerous compiler fixes
* JunOS support enabled & fixed
* Portability to Dragonfly BSD (treat as FreeBSD)
* Bugfix for Cisco export

Version 4.8.4:

A couple of crash bugs reported by Hagen Boehm were fixed.

Hagen has also reported a bug in the handling of more-specific
specifiers for IPv6 prefixes. He has submitted a patch, but under
certain circumstances this causes applications to use a huge amount of
memory and CPU, so it has not been included in this release. A full
fix will be integrated later.

Version 4.8.3:

A set of patches collected by Hagen Boehm was applied.

Also, a few changes were made to allow the code to compile with the
lastest version of g++.

As of 4.8.3, binaries will no longer be made put on the FTP site for 
new versions.

Version 4.8.1:

This release contains prototypes of RPSLng-aware tools from
IRRToolSet: peval, rpslcheck and now RtConfig is added.

* RPSLng dictionary implemented according to the latest RPSLng draft:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blunk-rpslng-01.txt

* Tools have been tested to work with RIPE whois software. They will
  work also with irrd in most of the cases, as soon as irrd is updated
  to handle RPSLng-related objects. Separated patch for this may be
  necessary and will be available later.

* peval now accepts both RPSL and RPSLng filters (extended to support
  ipv6) for peval, the syntax for evaluation of mp-filter is:
  afi <afi_list> <mp-filter>
  results will be restricted to address familiy(ies) from <afi_list>.

* RtConfig has got a new command: '@RtConfig v6networks', which works
  symmetrically with '@RtConfig networks'. Other RtConfig commands
  have been modified to handle RPSLng.
