		all options (except -help, -version and -f) are allowed
		example: "@IRReval -config ios -asn16"

	man page updated
		new options and configuration line added

4.8.4-HB2.2

* The RAWhoisClient have been extended to handle and pass on 32bit AS numbers using
  the same algorithm as coded in rpsl.l and command.l.

* Problems with uninitialized memory allocation in Buffer fixed. Getting the source
  code of Buffer/List (src/Core/util) from latest release 4.8.5.

* Renaming the test-files (test) eg:cisco, eg:gated and eg:rsd to files with '.'
  (eg.cisco ...) to checkout working copies on a windows system correctly.

4.8.4-HB2.1

* The flex scanners (rpsl.l and command.l) have been extended to handle and pass on
  32bit AS numbers correctly.

  Valid notations are:
    16bit AS numbers-   "AS16" or "0.AS16"
    32bit AS numbers-   "AS32" or "AS16.AS16"

4.8.4-HB2.0

* The flex scanners (rpsl.l and command.l) have been extended to handle and pass on
  32bit AS numbers. Data structures carrying AS numbers were revised such that those
  numbers are now stored in unsigned int variables. By default however 32bit AS numbers
  are still translated into AS23456. Whether 32bit AS numbers are translated or used as
  they are depends on a boolean value (useASN32 for rpsl.l and useASN32Command for
  command.l).

  When resolving as-sets via irrd no flex scanner is used to check the retrieved AS
  numbers since the response is not RPSL. Therefore the routines that check the AS
  numbers, translate them or pass them on as they are were copied to the appropriate
  positions in the irrd implementation (src/irr/rawhoisc.cc). The boolean value used
  to indicate usage of 32bit numbers here is stored in useASN32 in irr.hh.

  To prevent 32bit AS numbers being translated into AS23456 one just has to set the
  boolean variables appropriately (true). For IRReval access to these variables has
  been implemented. Via a new option "-asn32" the IRReval user can set these booleans to
  true and guanrantee that 32bit AS numbers are not translated!

  Finally the IRReval backends (IOSConfig, IOSXRConfig, JunosConfig) which are
  producing vendor specific as-path lists have been adjusted to produce appropriate
  code when 32bit AS numbers are used.

* When IRReval is used to produce RPSL route-set objects and address family is set to
  any, an empty line is produced between ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes which breaks the
  object. This problem was fixed.

4.8.4-HB1.9

* The implementations of irrd and ripe have been revised and, in case of irrd, extended
  regarding the Proxy tunneling capability. Since some Proxies might send some
  additional header-lines with the "HTTP 200" response, which are unknown to irrd, the
  protocol implementation of irrd was extended to accept all Proxy responses starting
  with "HTTP/1.0 200 " or "HTTP/1.1 200 " as the Proxy's notification for a successful
  tunnel establishment. In addition both protocols now communicate via HTTP1.1 instead
  of HTTP1.0 with the Proxy. Also some optimizations were applied to the code.

* The prefix-filters produced in JunOS code by RtConfig and IRReval have
  been changed syntactically. They now semantically conform to the RPSL
  expression they are produced from. Before, when RtConfig or JunOS
  generated IPv4 or IPv6 route lists for JunOS, a single term was generated
  holding all "route-filter" statements necessary to define the filter.
  For example when IRReval was used

  @IRReval prefix-list blub afi ipv6 {::/0^0-120} AND NOT {::/1^10}

  evaluated to

  policy-statement blub {
     term prefixes {
        from {
           route-filter ::/0 upto /9 accept;
           route-filter ::/0 prefix-length-range /11-/120 accept;
           route-filter 8000::/1 prefix-length-range /10-/10 accept;
        }
     }
     term catch-rest {
        then reject;
     }
  }

  But when prefix 8003::20FF:100/120 is evaluated against this route list it
  is catched by the third "route-filter" line, due to JunOS longest-prefix-
  match evaluation. Because of the mismatch of the prefix-length-range the
  prefix then gets dropped, although it should be accepted as the RPSL
  expression tells.
  Now, in version v4.8.4-HB1.9 a single term for each "route-filter" line is
  generated, ensuring that the filter works as intended by the RPSL expression.
  The example policy-statement now becomes:

  policy-statement blub {
     term prefixes0 {
        from {
           route-filter ::/0 upto /9 accept;
        }
     }
     term prefixes1 {
        from {
           route-filter ::/0 prefix-length-range /11-/120 accept;
        }
     }
     term prefixes2 {
        from {
           route-filter 8000::/1 prefix-length-range /10-/10 accept;
        }
     }
     term catch-rest {
        then reject;
     }
  }

* The IRReval man page was updated and corrected and moved from src/IRReval/IRReval.1 to
  man/man1/IRReval.1.

4.8.4-HB1.8

* a syntax bug in IRReval, occurring when producing empty or complete JunOS
  prefix-filters was fixed. In addition the production of empty or complete
  JunOS prefix-filters in IRReval was optimized.

4.8.4-HB1.7

* a bug in handling the "end of input" signal (e.g. given via Ctrl-D) when
  executing IRReval in "rpsl" configuration format mode was fixed.

* the output format of RPSL objects generated by IRReval in "rpsl"
  configuration format mode was slightly changed to optimize the creation of
  IRR cache files from the generated objects.

* the lex scanner was enhanced to support 32bit AS numbers. Since there is
  no support for 32bit AS numbers in any tool of the IRRToolSet, any 32bit
  AS number is translated into the 16bit AS number AS23456 immediately after it
  was scanned.

* a bug in reporting the discovery of IRR cache file objects with the same
  name was fixed. Output of the objects content is now omitted and the report
  message was adjusted.

* a bug in handling 32bit AS numbers when expanding RPSL as-set objects via the
  irrd protocol was fixed. Instead of processing only the first 16bit and
  ignoring the rest following the '.', any 32bit AS number is now translated
  into the 16bit AS number AS23456.

4.8.4-HB1.6

* a bug in the evaluation of negated route-set expressions containing IPv4 as
  well as IPv6 prefixes was fixed. 

* a bug in the "rpsl" config-format representation of IPv4 route-sets
  evaluating to ANY was fixed.

* a limitation in the representation of route-sets evaluating to ANY or NOT_
  ANY when the selected address family is "any", "any.unicast" or
  "any.multicast" was removed. Those route-sets now can be represented in
  config-formats "ios", "iosxr" and "junos" too.

* the "restriction" routines in the "SetOfPrefix" and "SetOfIPv6Prefix" header
  files, used to restrict an RPSL expression to the specified address family,
  were improved to speed up the process.

4.8.4-HB1.5

* routines for counting IPv6 prefix lines were added to the RPSLConfig class.
  When IRReval is producing route-set objects in configuration format "rpsl"
  the IPv6 prefix lines are counted now and the total number of lines is
  printed in a comment line. IPv6 prefixes actually are not yet counted since
  their number can exceed a 64-bit Integer and there are no bigger Integers
  available at htis time. Furthermore, the counting routines for IPv4 prefixes
  were optimized or adjusted.

* The IRReval man page was updated to correctly document IRReval commands.
  Affected sections are "DESCRIPTION" and "IRReval COMMANDS".

* The evaluation of RPSL cache file objects was revised: error detection and
  reporting was upgraded and the pattern matching that detects the type of an
  RPSL object was tightened to correct a bug. The bug occured when an object
  contained comment lines which included RPSL key-words like "as-set, "route-
  set". In this case the determination of the object's type could be incorrect.

4.8.4-HB1.4b

* the patch reparing the evaluation of negated route-sets into IOS XR and RPSL
  configuration formats for IPv4 was extended to IPv6. In this regard bugs in
  the IPv6 Radix tree implementation were fixed too.

* Independently of the configured configuration format IRReval now generates a
  warning message by default if a route-set evaluates to ANY or NOT ANY.

4.8.4-HB1.4a

* negation of IPv4 route-sets in IOS XR and RPSL format was repaired in
  IRReval. A negated route-set "A" is now calculated by mapping "A" to
  "{0.0.0.0/0^0-32} AND A" when config format is IOS XR or RPSL. This patch
  affects IPv4 route-sets only.

4.8.4-HB1.3

* cache file support was enabled for protocol irrd/rawhoisd. When specifying
  an RPSL cache file with option "-f" and when using protocol irrd/rawhoisd,
  route-sets and as-sets are recursively looked up in the cache file firstly
  before an irrd/rawhoisd query is sent to an IRR database. router-sets however
  are not supported. (affected files: src/irr/irr.hh, src/irr/irr.cc,
  src/irr/rawhoisc.cc)

* instead of just reporting errors detected while scanning and parsing RPSL
  objects with lex and yack the program now terminates immediately after
  detection of the first error. (changes have made to src/rpsl/rpsl/object.cc)

4.8.4-HB1.2

* IRReval was adjusted to fit into the TROPOS v1.2 process chain
  where it now replaces RtConfig.

* the work-around for the JunOS route list evaluation process
  problem from version 4.8.4-HB1.1 has been integrated in IRReval
  (affected file: src/IRReval/JunosConfig.cc).

* patch patch-485-02 has been brought in RtConfig as well as in IRReval.
  This patch fixes a bug in the string manipulation of IOS as-path
  list definitions. 

4.8.4-HB1.1

* For test cases a work-around for a problem with the JunOS route
  list evaluation process has been implemented in the JunOS
  prefix-filter printing routine. In class JunosConfig method
  printRoutes(SetOfPrefix& nets) (src/RtConfig/f_junos.cc) has been
  changed. Now this method generates a single term for each
  "route-filter" line. This is done to prevent prefix loss that
  occured at least for prefixes of length 24 in the following example:

      term prefixes {
         from {
           route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 upto /9 accept;
           route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 prefix-length-range /11-/24 accept;
           route-filter 128.0.0.0/1 prefix-length-range /10-/10 accept;
         }
      }

  The state before the work-around is saved in src/RtConfig/f_junos.cc.old

* A bug was fixed that inserted an unwanted Null character in a
  regular expression of an as-path list when generated by RtConfig
  as well as by IRReval. The cause was an "ends" command in the
  respective method wich was now deleted from

  - src/RtConfig/f_junos.cc
  - src/RtConfig/f_cisco.cc
  - src/IRReval/IOSConfig.cc
  - src/IRReval/JunosConfig.cc

4.8.5hb (which is actually 4.8.4-HB1.0)

* Several extensions like Proxy tunnel support, much better debug and
  error report support, etc.

* The new tool IRReval was introduced.

4.8.4

* A number of runtime problems which caused crashes were reported, and
  these have been fixed. Thanks to Hagen Boehm for discovering them.

4.8.3

A set of patches collected by Hagen Boehm was applied:

* whois.apnic.net server problem
  APNIC's whois server (RIPE NCC software with RPSS functions
  disabled) has changed syntax of some embedded comments in a way that
  violates the protocol assumptions in IRRToolSet 4.8.2
  (required/allowed "empty lines" ~ "\n\n" in the context of "%"
  comment lines. This problem seems to be around since APNIC switched
  to a database version supporting IPv6/RPSLng).
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* ASnnn embedded in AS-Set AS-xxxx doesn't resolve properly (prefix
  loss)
  We are seeing cases where resolving to route-sets (a) an ASnnn and
  (b) an AS-set AS-xxxx which includes ASnnn as a member lists some
  prefixes as members of ASnnn but NOT as members of AS-xxxx (Which
  turns something like "125.16.0.0/14^14-24" into some thousand
  separately listed 125.16.x.y/n^n-n or 125.16.x.y/n^m-m that don't
  combine into any 125.16.x.y/n^m-l unless m=l).
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* multi protocol filter problem 
  prefix filter consisting of ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes get not resolved
  properly.  Either only prefixes of a single protocol get resolved
  (e.g. only ipv4) or the route-set contains ANY. The first case was
  observed when resolving an "ASxxxx" filter, the latter case when
  resolving an "ASxxxx ASyyyy" filter, where both ASxxxx and ASyyyy
  contained ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* due to an uninitialized integer the irrd client showed erroneous
  behavior when processing responses to "selected source" queries
  (!s-lc).  This bug led to the closing of the session before an
  object query could be sent out.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* flex scanner token interpretation error.
  Due to missing tests on uninitialised values, missing
  NULL-termination on strings and bad memory allocation the flex
  scanner didn't work correctly and sometimes returned a wrong
  interpretation when reading a dotted "afi" value, e.g.
  "ipv6.unicast". Such values were interpreted as a DNS Token
  (TKN_DNS) instead of an afi Token (TKN_AFI). The incorrect
  interpretations irritated the bison parser and led to a system
  crash. 
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* After patching IRRTS 4.8.2 with the C&W patches repairing the
  missing JunOS route-set filter support, the tool-set didn't compile
  correctly anymore.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* IRRToolSet 4.8.2 doesn't support functionality of the
  -cisco_empty_lists flag anymore. Setting the -cisco_empty_lists flag
  hence has no effect. The patch restores the functionality.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* JunOS route filters aren't generated as compact as it is
  the case for Cisco IOS. Furthermore the JunOS route filter
  generation triggered by setting the -cisco_empty_lists flag doesn't
  create correct route filters. The patch makes JunOS route filters as
  compact as Cisco IOS route filters and repairs the JunOS route
  filters that are generated only when setting the -cisco_empty_lists
  flag.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* With RPSLng key-word "ANY" now can have different
  semantic interpretations: It can be the value of an Address Family
  (afi value) or it can be an rpsl_word. In some cases the lex scanner
  misinterprets "ANY" as afi value and returns TKN_AFI although the
  bison parser rules expect an rpsl_word (eg. TKN_WORD or KEYW_ANY).
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* The man pages of RtConfig and peval do not obviously
  document that the "-f" option, used for specifying a cache file, can
  be used repeatedly to specify more than one cache file. In the peval
  man page this option is not even mentioned!
  Furthermore the cache file parsing process does not alert when a
  cache object can't be identified.
  The patch adds documentation to the respective man pages and
  augments the code dealing with cache object handling.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* any "more specific operator" (i.e. ^+, ^-, ^N and ^N-M) does not
  work or does not work correctly when being applied on an IPv6
  route-set expression.
  Thanks to Hagen Boehm.

* A collection of patches from NetBSD.
  Thanks to Petra Zeidler.

* A few changes were made to allow the code to compile with the
  lastest version of g++.

Version 4.8.1:

This release contains prototypes of RPSLng-aware tools from
IRRToolSet: peval, rpslcheck and now RtConfig is added.

* RPSLng dictionary implemented according to the latest RPSLng draft:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blunk-rpslng-01.txt

* Tools have been tested to work with RIPE whois software. They will
  work also with irrd in most of the cases, as soon as irrd is updated
  to handle RPSLng-related objects. Separated patch for this may be
  necessary and will be available later.

* peval now accepts both RPSL and RPSLng filters (extended to support
  ipv6) for peval, the syntax for evaluation of mp-filter is:
  afi <afi_list> <mp-filter>
  results will be restricted to address familiy(ies) from <afi_list>.

* RtConfig has got a new command: '@RtConfig v6networks', which works
  symmetrically with '@RtConfig networks'. Other RtConfig commands
  have been modified to handle RPSLng.


4.8.2

* GCC-3.x compatible (tested with 3.3.2, 3.2.1 and 3.2) 
  Thanks to Glen Turner, Tony Li, and all others who have contributed the patches.

* draft-blunk-rpslng-07.txt implemented

* peval now handles multicast prefixes

* bugfixes in peval, RtConfig, rpslcheck

4.8.1
  
* RPSLng dictionary implemented for RtConfig (cisco format only).
  other configuration file formats are underway.

* The tools work with irrd too in most of the cases (see RELEASE-NOTES)

* import/export/default in aut-num are now treated as a partial case of corresponding mp-attributes.
  While having multiple attributes, the same logic applies for peering/action/filter selection.

* almost all RtConfig commands have been modified to support RPSLng, 1 new command added:
  "@RtConfig v6networks"

4.8.0

* RPSLng dictionary implemented
* only for peval, rpslcheck

4.7.3

* bugfixes & new in RtConfig, fixes in prpath, rpslcheck, libirr.
* man pages updated
* configure script patched for NetBSD (thanks to Jeff Rizzo (riz@equinix.com) for the patch)
* '-V RAToolSet' switch for whois queries using ripe whois is changed to '-V IRRToolSet<version>'

4.7.2
* various bugfixes in aoe: it is RIPE compliant, bug fixed, 
  error reporting improved.
* some bugs in RtConfig, roe and prpath fixed

4.7.1
* various bug fixes

4.7.0
* Added support for the new ripe server, please use -protocol ripe for it.
 For the perl based old ripe server, please use -protocol ripe_perl
 Note that the new ripe server support is at best beta quality. 
 Please watch out for and report any problems.
* ~*/~+ rpsl as path regular expressions are now supported for cisco configs.
  These lead to shorter regular expressions.
* If you are hitting cisco line limitation, you can force * and + to be
 interpreted as ~*, and ~+ which will shorten the config lines by using
 -cisco_force_tilda command line option. (i.e. without modifying your
 aut-num in IRR).
* We try to generate less parenthesis in as paths for ciscos.
* The limitation with JunOS as path printing regarding [^ ] operator is
 now removed. The JunOS can now handle all RPSL as path expressions. I
 did not implement ~*, ~+ in JunOS since they do not have a line length
 limitation. If your aut-num has ~*/~+, they are treated as if */+
 respectively .
* JunOS access lists are now compressed correctly (if turned on).
* bug fixes in map name format
* many other bug fixes

4.6.3
* portability fixes

4.6.2
* bug fixes

4.6.1
* CIDRAdvisor was core dumping if given an AS number who had no routes. 
* prtraceroute has problems on DU converting from FQDN to IP numbers.
* documented the "-protocol {irrd|bird|ripe}" option in the man pages

4.6.0
* junos support. RtConfig can now generate Juniper router
  configurations. The supported feature set is equivalent to the cisco
  feature set with less limitations. Please consider the generated config
  files beta quality, and manually check for errors before deploying to
  routers till we clean up any bugs that may show up. Please read the
  RtConfig man page for details.
* We now map rpsl pref values to gated/rsd pref values
  carefully. Gated/RSd can only handle 0-255 as a preference. We map the
  smallest preference the user used to 0, next smalles to 1, and so on...
* setting next-hop in a route map is now supported.
* several minor bug fixes.
* Digital Unix portability improvements. Still not perfect.

4.5.2
* an rsd bug fix

4.5.1
* Lost of bug fixes
* @RtConfig printSuperPrefixRanges <format> filter <filter>
  This command is same as the "printPrefixRanges" command, except it
  compresses more aggresively. The %n and %m information is lost.  But, %D,
  a set of dont care bits representing different %n-%m ranges are provided.

4.5.0
* bay router is now officially supported, use -config bcc
  kudos to Srivathsan Srinivasagopalan <vathsan@BayNetworks.COM>
  and Giovanni S Marzot <gmarzot@BayNetworks.COM>
* now compiles cleanly with egcs 2.95.*
* couple of minor bug fixes

4.4.4
* bug fix in gated/rsd aspath filter generation

4.4.3
* fixed the prpath/prtraceroute/cidradvisor bug for real

4.4.2
* Put a workaround to prpath/prtraceroute/cidradvisor that ignores
  routes with prefix lengths < 6. This causes as numbers to be AS1800 for
  all addresses, only with recent irrd.

4.4.1
* two new commands:
              @RtConfig printPrefixes <format> filter <filter>
                     <format> is a quoted string, and <filter> is
                     an RPSL filter over AS numbers, AS set names
                     and  route set names using operators AND, OR
                     and NOT.  This command instruct RtConfig  to
                     print  the  prefixes in <filter> using <for-
                     mat>.  The <format> can contain the  follow-
                     ing escape sequences:
                           %p  prefix
                           %l  length
                           %L  32-length
                           %n  n
                           %m  m
                           %k  mask
                           %K  inverse of mask (i.e. ~mask)
                           %%  %
                           \n  carriage return
                           \t  tab
                     Example, use:
              @RtConfig printPrefixes "net %p \tmask %k\n" filter AS1

              @RtConfig printPrefixRanges <format> filter <filter>
                     This command is same as the  "printPrefixes"
                     command, except the consecutive address pre-
                     fixes are compressed into a  single  address
                     prefix range.
* CIDRAdvisor is now ported to RPSL.

4.4.0
* 100% RPSL compliant!
*               -cisco_skip_route_maps
                     This option only  affects  cisco  configura-
                     tions.   This  option instructs RtConfig not
                     to print route maps, hence  it  only  prints
                     access lists.
* @RtConfig access_list filter <filter>
              @RtConfig access_list filter <filter>
                     <filter> is an RPSL filter over AS  numbers,
                     AS set names and route set names using oper-
                     ators  AND,  OR  and  NOT.    This   command
                     instruct RtConfig to generate an access list
                     for <filter>.
  E.g. @RtConfig access_list filter AS1 or AS6
  Note that no neighbor or map statements are generated.
* @RtConfig aspath_access_list filter <filter>
              @RtConfig aspath_access_list filter <filter>
                     <filter> is an RPSL filter over AS path reg-
                     ular expressions using operators AND, OR and
                     NOT.  This command instruct RtConfig to gen-
                     erate an as path access list for <filter>.
  E.g. @RtConfig aspath_access_list filter <^AS286 .* AS-EUNET$>
  Note that no neighbor or map statements are generated.
* One command router configuration "@RtConfig configureRouter rtr.isp.net"
              @RtConfig configureRouter <inet-rtr-name>
                     <inet-rtr-name> is the DNS name of an  inet-
                     rtr  object. This command will use the named
                     inet-rtr object, and  configure  import  and
                     export  policies  for each of the BGP4 peers
                     of the router (using the peer attribute).
* Use %d in map name as peer's AS number or to make it unique
              @RtConfig set cisco_map_name = <map-name>
                     <map-name> is a quoted string.  This command
                     instruct  RtConfig  to use <map-name> as the
                     name for the route maps generated.   If  the
                     <map-name>  contains %d, it will be replaced
                     by the peer's AS number.  If it  contains  a
                     second %d, it will be replaced by an integer
                     that is incremented each time a new  map  is
                     generated (to ensure unique map names).  The
                     default cisco_map_name is "MyMap_%d_%d".
* peval has now new option
              -compressed
                     Print  prefix  lists using the more specific
                     operators.  Otherwise,  an  expression  like
                     128.9.0.0/16^24  will result in 256 prefixes
                     being printed.
* peering group configuration
              @RtConfig importGroup <ASN-1> <peering-set-name>
              @RtConfig exportGroup <ASN-1> <peering-set-name>
                     <peering-set-name> is a name  of  a  peering
                     set object.  This command instructs RtConfig
                     to generate import  (export)  filters  where
                     <ASN-1> is importing (exporting) routes from
                     (to) the peers  listed  in  <peering-set-name>.
                     The  aut-num  object for <ASN-1> should have
                     an import (export) attribute using the peer-
                     ing set's name.
* prtraceroute is now ported to rpsl. (Thanks to John Mehringer).
* IRR file cache (-f option) can now have aut-num, as-set, route-set and
  inet-rtr objects.
* Much better error reporting using ^^^ pointers.
* RtConfig option -force_match_ip_inbound is deleted and its behaviour is
  now the default. Use the new option -no_match_ip_inbound to restore the
  old behaviour. 
* RtConfig will split very long "ip as-path access-list" lines over
  multiple lines.

  Splitting is activated if an "ip as-path" line longer than 250 characters
  is generated. (Cisco line length limit is 256).
  
  We search for the longest as number sequence in the expression
  (i.e. (ddd|ddd|...|ddd)) which is not inside the scope of a * or +
  operator and split that one into multiple lines.
  
  If there are multiple candidates for split, we only split the longest
  one. Splitting all candidates would be safer. 
  
  In short:
     <^AS286+ .* AS-EUNET$>	is splittable,
     <^AS286+ .* AS-EUNET*$>	is NOT splittable,
     <^AS286+ .* AS-EUNET+$>	is NOT splittable,
     <^AS286+ .* AS-EUNET AS-EUNET$>	is splittable
  
  In the last example, the splitted lines will still be too long.
  Let me know if any of you have as-path policy of this sort. It is more 
  work to split all splittable stuff, but it can be done.
* Fix for Cisco's fix of their prefix list access list bug.
* filter-set, peering-set, rtr-set classes are now recognized.
* RAToolSet no longer has a hidden list of IRR databases, if a -s option
  is not specified at the command line, it will use whatever the default
  is at the server. This should make no difference for those of you that
  use RADB. For others, watch out for surprises.

4.3.3
* RAToolSet now defaults to rpsl.merit.edu port 43 protocol IRRd

4.3.2
* bug fixes (solaris long long int bug, and aspath prepend bug)

4.3.1
* draft-ietf-rps-rpsl-v2-00 compliant
* examples under tests directory updated for v4 syntax
* got rid of -c option while connecting to RIPE-based server

4.3.0
* aoe, roe and prpath are back
* a very brief library documentation is included
* bug fixes
* compressing cisco access lists are now the default. To disable, please
  use the -cisco_no_compress_acls option.

4.2.0
* bug fixes
* gated and rsd support in RtConfig (this part is alpha code).

4.1.0
* Structured import and export with braces, semicolons, except and refine
  is implemented. They can be arbitrarily nested.
* PeerAS can now be used in prefix or as-path filters.
* @RtConfig static2bgp <ASN-1> <rtr-1>
  See man page.
* All community methods now work, cisco can not handle the delete method
  though. 
* New option -cisco_use_prefix_lists
  This option only  affects  cisco  configurations.  This option instructs
  RtConfig to output prefix-lists which yield higher performace than
  access-lists. This flag implies -cisco_compress_acls.
* Media local range 169.254.0.0/16^+ is now in the martians list.
* ^+, ^-, ^n, ^n-m can now be used with as numbers, rs-set and as-set
  names. e.g. AS226^+, RS-PRIVATE^19
* more control over acl numbers used. Check the man page for:
     @RtConfig set cisco_prefix_acl_no = 500
     @RtConfig set cisco_aspath_acl_no = 1500
     @RtConfig set cisco_community_acl_no = 3500
* There is also a new option -f <filename> where the file contains an
  aut-num object. RAToolSet uses the object's definition in the file
  instead of the one in IRR. This is mainly useful for testing. This
  option  may disappear in the future.
* roe/aoe is broken. They will be fixed in 4.1.1.
* Bugs fixed.

4.0.3
* Bugs fixed.

4.0.2
* Bug fixes
* Peval now has command line history (if you have gnu readline/history
libs)

4.0.1
* Bug fixes

4.0.0
* rpsl is implemented.
* in your templates, IP addresses should no longer have /32. i.e. use:
	@RtConfig export AS2764 203.63.80.17 AS1221 139.130.49.81
	not                                 /32                  /32
* as path and community access lists are now cached
* if you do not have a policy for a neighbor, RtConfig will generate a
  config file which imports no routes from that neighbor. Previously, it
  just ignored the RtConfig command for that neighbor.
* Please read README.v4 for things to watch for.

3.5.7
* Portability improved. Warnings during compilation is now avoided.
* In printing packet filters the prefix 0.0.0.0/0 is ignored.
* The following lists are also sorted:
	cisco packet filters
	cisco default statements
	gated prefix list policy filters
	rsd prefix list policy filters
* RtConfig now accepts the following command:
	@RtConfig outbound_pkt_filter <if-name> <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
  Same as pkt_filter but using as-out instead of as-in. Please see the man 
  page.

3.5.6 
* A new radix tree implementation is in place. So
  -cisco_compress_acls now works and resulting access lists are
  sorted.
* RtConfig now accepts the following command:
	@RtConfig pkt_filter <if-name> <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
  Man page has the details. This is useful for filtering data packets 
  whose source address does not belong to your customers 
  (e.g. smurf packets).

3.5.5
* RtConfig now accepts the following commands.
     @RtConfig set cisco_map_first_no = 5
     @RtConfig set cisco_map_increment_by = 10
  Man page has the details. This is useful for inserting other statements 
  to the route maps.
* Bug fixed: RtConfig failed on expressions like "accept AS1 OR <AS1>".
* Bug fixed: Our radix tree based set implementation turned out to be
  very bugy and consumed enormous resources. I rolled back our old set
  implementation that used splay trees. This means, access lists will
  no longer be sorted:-( Also, -compressACLS will not work. 
* aoe now has a revert button, when pressed it re-reads the object from IRR.

3.5.4
* RAToolSet has been modified to adapt Tcl/Tk 8.0 by changing it's
  naming convention.  This will make roe and aoe taking the advantage of
  newest Tcl/Tk in terms of speed.
* A multi-homed's bug on prtraceroute has been fixed by checking out
  the interfaces from the kernel.  Linux and Solaris porting have also been
  integrated.  
* RAToolSet installation script has been improved so that it will
  create directories if they do not exist.  This will smooth the
  installation process without any human interference.  
* RtConfig has been enhanced to generate compressed ACLs for Cisco
  routers.  This will shorten the ACLs and hence use less memory on Cisco
  routers.

3.5.3
* Radix trie has been added for RtConfig so that sorted access list 
  will be generated.
* Balloon help for roe has been added to show the range of each address prefix.
* Bugs fixed for roe from being crashed. 
* aoe has different resource file (~/.aoerc) format.  Users should delete
  the old one and let aoe generates a new one.
* aoe provides template for the "changed:" field and appends/replaces
  it automatically.
* Bug fixed for prtraceroute from being crashed in Solaris.  Thanks
  Bob Coggeshall for pointing it out.
* Clean up all the memory leaking problems.

3.5.1
* This version contains a couple of minor bugs fixed for RtConfig.  Thanks
  "David M. Meyer" <meyer@network-services.uoregon.edu> for pointing them
  out.

3.5.0
* This version contains the beta release of aoe, Autonomous System
  Object Editor:
     aoe simplifies the creation of aut-num objects by employing some
     heuristics to add and modify as-in and as-out attributes.  For
     example, given a BGP dump from a router inside your AS, aoe
     parses the AS_PATH attributes in the BGP dump, and determines the
     peer ASes, and the import policies for each peer AS.  A template
     based mechanism is provided for users to create their own
     heuristics to augment the heuristics that we provide.  aoe can
     register the aut-num object in the IRR after editing is done.
* RtConfig has couple of new features:
        -supress_martian option
        -@RtConfig networks commands
        -@RtConfig default commands
* There are also some minor bug fixes.

3.4.0
* This version has man pages for all tools. There are new tools, quite a
  few improvements and bug fixes. Since there are so many changes please
  regard this version as alpha.
* Here are the list of tools:
    peval                 improvements and bug fixes
    pmatch                more options
    prpath                more options
    RtConfig              improvements and bug fixes
    CIDRAdvisor           completely rewritten with all new options
    prcheck               no changes
    roe                   no changes
    relayd                new tool
    prtraceroute          new tool

2.9
* peval now has registers. register store the results of previous
  evaluations. To enable, one needs to use either -registers option or
  -config option of peval. E.g.
	./peval -registers
	peval> set $a AS1
	peval> $a
	((AS1))
* code has been reorganized. gnu libraries is now all in one sub directory
  parse tree node* code has been cleaned and sped up.
* autoconf tested on sunos solaris alpha/osf ultrix
2.8
* yyparse now parses the stdin. Peval used to read stdin and pass it to
  yyparse.
* When debugging is enabled (w/ -DDEBUG), execution is no longer slowed
  down if debugging is not enabled at run time with -D command line option.
* The extended/original attribute interaction as discussed in IETF July 95
  has been implemented.
* Better error/warning messages:
	Warning: aut-num object of AS690 has no as-out line for peer AS3561.
	Warning: Community COMM has no registered routes or does not exist.
* RtConfig now supports RSd configuration file format.
