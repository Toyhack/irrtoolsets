detail:

Might be changed in f_cisco.cc, and in every implementation to print acls for ANY/NOT ANY expressions. Now only empty route maps are printed. Need to consider if we need this local hack (printing in print()), or drop empty route-map, or do not change the behaviour or close the bug.

decided to change error message only. empty route maps are still generated.
further discuss for the next release?

see also 024.
Finally:

implemented -cisco_empty_lists option:
when on, prints warnings for ANY/NOT ANY and matching acls.
when off, print only warnings.
Works for cisco only.
