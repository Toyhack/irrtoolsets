summary: "generate policy from peer's aut-num" broken

detail:

The previous implementation was not actually working. Also full
peering descriptions (peer peer_IP local_IP) were not taken into account.  I
used the classes AutNumPeeringGenerator to iterate the peerings (of Peering
class), and AutNumSelector<AttrExport> to find the policies for the
particular peering (not only ASno!). Also FilterAction to pick up the filter
from the policy.

aoe/aoe.cc              int ListPeer::generatePolicyFromPeer(int iImport, int iExport,
                                     ASt tMyAS, 
                                     ASt tPeerAS, const AutNum *pcPeerAutNum, 
                                     TclText *pcText, int iPeerASType)
