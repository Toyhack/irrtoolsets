detail:

Didn't work. Functions mentioned were not implemented. Used
existing class AutNumPeeringIterator. Also duplicated peers in the Peer
List. This happens when complex policies are parsed from aut-num. Solved by
cASPeers.insertSortedNoDups(new ASPeer(peering->peerAS, dASPeerFromIRR));
instead of using append();
