.SH NAME
roe (Route Object Editor)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B roe
.RI [ flags ]\ [<as-no>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
roe is a C++/Tcl/Tk program that lists the routes registered by <as-no>.
roe can be used to find discrepancies between the registered routes 
and the routes that are actually being routed.
roe can be used to find all the holes that are punched in the AS's routes,
or all the holes the AS punches in other routes.
roe can be used to easily add, delete and update route objects in any IRR
registry (hence the name editor).
For example,
one can register all the routes which are routed but not registered in
couple of mouse clicks.
If <as-no> is not specified it is deduced for your
system from the IP address of your host and IRR. 
.SH RAToolSet COMMON OPTIONS
.RS
.IP -help
Print summary of command-line options and abort.
.IP "\-T [whois_query | whois_response | input | all]"
Trace the argument. Useful for debugging.
.IP "\-D <integer>"
Print debugging messages of debug channel <integer> 
(if compiled with DEBUG defined).
.IP "\-version"
Print the version number and quit.
.IP "\-h <host-name>"
Establish an RAWhoisd connection to host <host-name>.

This means that roe obtains its data only from
<host-name>. If it displays routes from other
registries, those are the mirror copies of those routes
in <host-name>. However, roe can update any registry,
not just <host-name>.
.IP "\-p <port-no>"
Establish an RAWhoisd connection to port <port-no>.
.IP "\-protocol <protocol>"
Use the <protocol> to connect to the IRR server. <protocol> can be irrd,
ripe, and bird. The default is irrd. The ripe option should be used with
the old ripe server.
.IP "\-s <source-list>"
Consider the sources specified in the comma separated <source-list>.
For example, -s RADB,MCI,CANET,ANS,RIPE
.IP \-rusage
Print resource usage upon completion.
.IP "\-ignore_errors"
Do not print error and warning messages due to communication to the
database server or parsing policy objects.
.IP "\-report_errors"
Print error and warning messages due to communication to the
database server or parsing policy objects.
.RE
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.RS
.IP "\-as <as-no>"
Lists routes of <as-no>. 
.IP "-rcfile <resource filename>"
.IP "\-display <X Windows Display Specification>"
.IP "\-geometry <X Windows Geometry Specification>"
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.RS
.IP IRR_HOST
Specifies the RAWhoisd host to connect.
.IP IRR_PORT
Specifies the RAWhoisd port number to connect.
.IP IRR_SOURCES
Specifies the source list (comma separated) to consider.
.RE
.PP
Command line options take precedence over environment variables.
.SH USAGE
.PP
Invoke roe using your AS number,
.nf
	% roe AS226
.fi
roe will acquire and display the set of address prefixes that are
registered with your AS as the origin.
Afterwards, 
in the background,
next to each address prefix it will display a set of IRR registry and AS number
pairs.
This information signifies that
a route object for this prefix is registered in the IRR registry by the
origin displayed.
In addition,
next to each route some of the followed words may be displayed:
.RS
.IP NotReg 
to signify that the route is not registered,
.IP NotRtd 
to signify that the route is not routed (according to a BGP dump),
.IP OtrHmd 
to signify that the route is homed to an AS other than yours,
.IP MltHmd 
to signify that the route is homed to more than one AS
and one of which is your AS,
.IP MHmOtr 
to signify that the route is homed to more than one AS
and none of which is your AS,
.IP --- 
to signify that the route's status is not yet determined.

.RE
If you select an address prefix by clicking left mouse button on it,
a set of buttons will be displayed,
each corresponding to the registry and AS number pairs
of the selected address prefix.
Clicking on these buttons will display the object's definition in the
lower left window.
To delete (update or add) an object, 
press the delete (update or add) button,
followed by the schedule button.
In the lower right window,
all the scheduled transactions are listed.
You can select any of them to display the object which is scheduled.
The selected transaction can be unscheduled by clicking on the cancel
button.
Transactions are carried out to update the IRR when the Update IRR button
is pressed.
.PP
If you click on the Update IRR button,
a set of windows will pop-up,
one for each registry and maintainer pair.
In this window make sure that the program to pipe is correct, and in the body
of the message add any authorization words that may be necessary (such as
passwords).
Then, click either on the Update button or on the Cancel button to
commit your scheduled transactions, or to skip them forever.
The affect of your updates are not immediately shown on the display,
since IRR currently may take up to a day to propagate all the changes
back to the server that roe connected to.
.PP
It is possible to select more than one address prefixes. 
Selecting more than one address prefixes is useful for the commands in
the menu bar.
To select more than one address prefix which are not contiguous, 
click the left
mouse button while holding the control key down.
This toggles the selection status of the address prefix under the pointer.
For more options,
please refer to 
the default bindings section for the extended listboxes
in Tk listbox man page.
.SH MENUS
.PP
.RS
.IP "File/Compare with BGP dump"
A file name will be prompted. 
This file should contain the set of address prefixes that your AS
originates.
The file format is the following. 
Each line contains a classless address prefix (e.g. 128.8.0.0/15)
or a classfull address (e.g. 128.9.0.0) followed by any other data which
is skipped.
A line that does not have either a classless or classfull address that starts
in the first five columns is skipped.
The BGP dump generated by the command "show ip BGP regexp ^$" meets the
requirements of this file.
If you have a BGP dump in another format,
you should convert it to a file 
which lists the address prefixes (classless or classfull), 
one at a line.
.IP "File/Quit"
This item causes roe to exit.
.PP
.IP "Show"
roe displays address prefixes that match a display criteria.
By default all address prefixes match the display criteria.
Show menu changes the current display criteria.
It consist of 4 parts.
All parts are explained below in detail.
The last three parts control the three main criteria,
registration criterion,
routed criterion,
homed criterion.
Each criterion can have several values.
For a route to be shown on display
it has to match one of the selected values of all three criteria.
A common mistake is to select a value for one of the criterion
and select no value for the other two criteria.
This will not display any routes
since no routes will match the other two criteria.
Often what is meant can be achieved
by selecting one value in one criterion 
and all values in the other criteria.
.PP
.IP "Show/Show None"
This menu item
makes no address prefix match the display criteria.
.IP "Show/Show All"
This menu item
makes all address prefixes match the display criteria.
.IP "Show/Show Again"
Whether an address prefix matches the display criteria can change in time 
since certain criteria can only be determined after roe
acquired the registration information from IRR,
which it does in the background.
This menu item redisplays the list of address prefixes
using the information currently acquired.
.IP "Show/Not Registered"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are not registered in IRR.
These address prefixes are most likely introduced 
by a compare with BGP dump operation.
.IP "Show/Singly Registered"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are registered by only one route object.
.IP "Show/Multi Registered"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are registered by more than one route object.
.IP "Show/Undetermined"
Match the set of address prefixes 
for which neither of the above is determined yet.
.IP "Show/Routed"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are routed according to the BGP dumps compared.
.IP "Show/Not Routed"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are not routed according to the BGP dumps compared.
.IP "Show/Undetermined"
Match the set of address prefixes 
for which neither of the above is determined yet.
.IP "Show/Single Homed to Your AS"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are registered by only your AS.
.IP "Show/Single Homed to Other AS"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are registered by only one AS other than your AS.
.IP "Show/Multi Homed"
Match the set of address prefixes 
that are registered by more than one AS.
.IP "Show/Undetermined"
Match the set of address prefixes 
for which neither of the above is determined yet.
.PP
.IP "Selection/Select All"
Select all routes currently being displayed.
.IP "Selection/UnSelect All"
Unselect all routes currently being displayed.
.IP "Selection/Add Selected Routes"
Add a route object for all the selected address prefixes
using the add template in the Configure/Templates menu.
.IP "Selection/Delete Selected Routes"
Delete all route objects for the selected address prefixes
from any registry that they are registered in,
using the delete template in the Configure/Templates menu.
.IP "Selection/Delete Selected Routes from"
Delete all route objects for  the selected address prefixes
from the registry that you will be prompted for,
using the delete template in the Configure/Templates menu.
.IP "Selection/Get More Specifics"
List any address prefix registered in IRR 
which is a more specific of the selected routes.
This option takes around a minute or two when it is invoked for the first
time.
.IP "Selection/Get Less Specifics"
List any address prefix registered in IRR
which is a less specific of the selected routes.
This option takes around a minute or two when it is invoked for the first
time.
.PP
If you are interested for the more specifics and less specifics of all
your routes, do the following: (1) select all routes, (2) get more
specifics, (3) select all routes, (4) get less specifics. If you change
the order and get the less specifics first, you will display all the
routes registered in IRR,
since 0.0.0.0/0 is registered. 
Doing this requires significant amount of memory.
.PP
.IP "Configure/Templates"
There are add, delete and update templates.
The add template is used to create new route objects.
It should contain all the attributes that you include in your route objects.
You can (and should) refer to $ROUTE, $AS, and
$DATE macros anywhere in your templates. 
These will be substituted by the
actual address prefix, the as number and the current day correspondingly.
.PP
The update template is used when an object definition is updated.
It should at least contain a changed attribute
and may contain other attributes.
The delete template is used when an object is going to be deleted.
It should contain only the delete attribute,
and no other attribute 
(if you put other attributes, 
the object will not be deleted
since an exact match except for the delete attribute is required for deletion).
.IP "Configure/IRR Update Commands"
A window displaying the IRR registries and the update commands will pop-up.
Roe will pipe the data to the update command 
to update the corresponding registry.
.IP "Configure/Revert to Factory Settings"
Change above configuration options to factory settings.
.IP "Configure/Save Options"
Save the configuration options to file ~/.roerc.
.IP "Configure/Reload Options"
Reload the configuration options from file ~/.roerc.
.RE
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE USES
Following uses may be of interest.
Prepare a BGP dump of your routes.
Invoke roe. 
Do a "File/Compare with BGP dump".
Wait till pending replies reaches 0.
.PP
1. Show "Not Registered" and "Routed" routes.
Register all of these routes.
You can use "Selection/Select All" followed by "Selection/Add Selected Routes".
.PP
2. Select "Not Routed", "Singly Registered", "Multi Registered"
and "Single Homed to Your AS" routes.
Unregister all of these routes.
You can use "Selection/Select All" followed by 
"Selection/Delete Selected Routes".
.PP
3. Select "Not Routed", "Singly Registered", "Multi Registered"
and "Multi Homed with Your AS" routes.
Unregister only your own registrations.
You need to do this one by one.
.PP
4. Select "Multi Registered", "Routed",
and "Single Homed to Your AS" routes.
You only need one copy of these routes in IRR.
Pick one registry in IRR as your primary registry.
Unregister the extra copies from the non-primary registries.
You can use "Selection/Select All" followed by 
"Selection/Delete Selected Routes from".
.PP
.SH FILES
roe creates a ~/.roerc file which stores the templates and the update
commands. This file is not meant for hand editing.
.PP
.SH SUGGESTION
Joachim Schmitz points out that it is not necessarily the best
choice to use a "show ip bgp regex ^$" within the home AS 
(which is IBGP routes) to study consistency of route objects in
the IRRs and the actual routes.  He advises to get an EBGP table 
from an external peer using "show ip bgp regex ^<as-no>"
